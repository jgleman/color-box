# color-box

Another JS/TS Color Utility Library (inspired by [https://date-fns.org](date-fns)).

I started writing this set of color utilities as a way for me to learn
TypeScript and publishing on npm. If you need a color library today, there are
quite a few libraries out there for working with colors in
JavaScript already.

To Do List:

- more functionality (mix, desaturate etc)
- alpha support
- additional color formats
- clean up API
- testing
- documentation
- so, so much more

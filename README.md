Another JavaScript Color Utility Library

I started writing this set of color utilities as a way for me to learn
TypeScript and to learn how to build packages to publish on npm.

If you need a color library today, there are quite a few libraries
out there for working with colors in JavaScript already.

To Do List:

- figure out how to get what I've written packaged and usable as an import
- so, so much more...

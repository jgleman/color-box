/**
 * Implementation to the Sass mix function. Returns a color thatâ€™s a mixture of
 * color1 and color2. Both the weight and the relative opacity of each color
 * determines how much of each color is in the result.
 *
 * @param color1
 * @param color2
 * @param [weight=50]  The weight must be a number between 0 and 100 (inclusive) representing a percentage. A larger weight indicates that more of color1 should be used, and a smaller weight indicates that more of color2 should be used.
 * @returns the mixed color
